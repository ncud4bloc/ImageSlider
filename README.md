# ImageSlider
JQuery UI demo for Odin Project

Future upgrades and refactoring are planned. I currently switch pictures by changing the background image for the single 
photo div. I will change this by making multiple photo divs all with display: none except for the active. This will allow 
me to use the slide method instead of the fade method. Also plan on tying the timing into the click functionality, as they 
are currently independent and interfere with each other.
